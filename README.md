# FriendFinder

Compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application is basically a dating app but can also be platonic. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Express handles application routing.  The application is also deployed to heroku.  Press <a href ="https://aqueous-river-88890.herokuapp.com/survey">here to check it out and find your next friend match!
